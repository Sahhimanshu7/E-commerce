# E-Commerce

### Description: 
E-Commerce is, as the name suggests, an e-commerce progressive web app that lets users buy and sell products. The site includes a content management system(CMS) page for all users, including sellers where they can manage their profile and track their earnings and expenditures. The site also uses content-based filtering to recommend users desired products and services based on their activities.

### Why another e-commerce site?
E-commerce sites like Amazon and Temu have always made me wonder how everything fits together. To hopefully answer my questions, I set on a journey to make my e-commerce site that would include all the functionalities of the mainstream e-commerce sites. 

## Built with
- React
- Node
- Express
- Mongoose Atlas

## Quick start
The project is divided into two folders, each used for different functionalities. 'client' for frontend application and "server" for backend.

### Prerequisites

- npm 
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
### Installation 
```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone npm https://github.com/Sahhimanshu7/E-commerce
